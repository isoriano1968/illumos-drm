# Links, loads, tests and unloads rdrmnull on an illumos test machine: the
# R0 test (core ioctls, authentication, master, file limits) and the R1
# test (GEM objects, dumb buffers, mmap, FLINK/OPEN, the refault experiment
# and the release from interrupt context), with the gem kstat and the vmem
# arenas recorded before unload. Run as root in a directory that holds:
#
#   rdrmnull.a       from `cargo xtask build rdrmnull`
#   rdrmnull.conf    usr/src/uts/common/io/rdrmnull/rdrmnull.conf
#   drm_r0_test.c    usr/src/test/drm-tests/drm_r0_test.c
#   drm_r1_test.c    usr/src/test/drm-tests/drm_r1_test.c
#   drm_r2_test.c    usr/src/test/drm-tests/drm_r2_test.c (optional: the R2 test runs
#                    when it is present; fences, sync objects, sync files,
#                    PRIME, with the sync kstat recorded before unload,
#                    and a refused detach that must leave the display and
#                    the sync paths working, checked with modetest from
#                    $MODETEST, default /opt/drm-tests/amd64/modetest,
#                    package system/test/libdrm)
#   drm/             the patched libdrm 2.4.109 headers (usr/src/tools/uapi/generate.sh)
#   drm-test-lib.sh  usr/src/test/drm-tests/drm-test-lib.sh
#   drm_module.a     from `cargo xtask build drm-module`, and drm_core.mapfile
#                    (usr/src/uts/common/io/drm/drm_core/drm_core.mapfile), unless misc/drm_core
#                    is installed already
#
# rdrmnull's nodes are card<N> and renderD<128+N> for the device number N
# it gets from misc/drm_core, which other DRM drivers attached at the same
# time (virtio_gpu) share; the script finds them through /dev/dri and hands
# them to the tests in DRM_CARD, DRM_RENDER and DRM_CARD1.
#
# RDRMNULL_CONF names another .conf to install instead of rdrmnull.conf:
# usr/src/test/drm-tests/rdrmnull-two.conf (two devices, for the R2 cross-device
# checks), or
# the DMA drill variants usr/src/test/drm-tests/rdrmnull-dma-self.conf and
# rdrmnull-dma-root-node.conf (see usr/src/uts/common/io/rdrmnull/src/lib.rs). With
# dma-mode "self" or "root-node" the R1 test expects every object to be
# bound for DMA. "self" attaches under the root nexus, which leaves the
# instance in /etc/path_to_inst after rem_drv (the /etc check fails), and
# "root-node" is expected to panic the machine.
#
# The machine needs gcc and the libdrm 2.4.109 library in /usr/lib/xorg/amd64
# (x11/library/libdrm). The script changes nothing outside this directory
# except for installing the driver under /usr/kernel/drv, add_drv/rem_drv,
# and the /dev links devfsadm creates and removes; it undoes all of them and
# fails unless the driver files in /etc and the /devices tree hash the same
# afterwards as before. Kernel panics are possible with any kernel module
# under test: use a disposable VM.
