# G10: the device nodes of the packaged illumos-drm drivers after a cold
# boot. Each driver action gives its card and render nodes
# "* 0666 root sys" (/etc/minor_perm), but ttymon(8) of console-login
# applies the /etc/logindevperm rule "/dev/vt/console_user 0600 /dev/dri/*"
# when it opens the console (di_devperm_logout(), at every boot and after
# every console logout): it sets every /dev/dri node to 0600 root root, and
# devfs keeps that in the node's shadow on the root file system across
# reboots, so unprivileged processes could not open the render nodes.
# svc:/system/graphics/drm-perms (driver/graphics/drmadm) runs
# "drmadm perms" before console-login: it restricts the rule to the
# legacy drivers and resets nodes left so to their minor_perm values.
#
#   arm        arms anonymous DTrace for the next boot (DRM node changes,
#              ttymon's reads of /etc/logindevperm, renames onto it); with
#              REVERT=1 it first restores the packaged /etc/logindevperm
#              (pkg revert), whose rule applies to every driver, as on the
#              first boot after an installation. Reboot afterwards;
#              coldboot fails if the boot it armed has no trace (and with
#              REQUIRE_TRACE=1 if any boot has none).
#   coldboot   right after a boot, before anything opened a DRM node:
#              drm-perms is online and came online in this boot before
#              console-login started; with a trace from arm, ttymon -g
#              read /etc/logindevperm and changed no DRM node, and
#              drm-perms' rename of the file came before that read; every
#              /etc/logindevperm rule for /dev/dri leaves the new stack's
#              drivers out; every /dev/dri node of a new-stack driver is
#              0666 root sys, as /etc/minor_perm says, for the devices in
#              EXPECT (default "virtio_gpu cdrmnull", one instance each;
#              empty with the legacy stack selected);
#              nobody opens every card and render node read-write; after
#              a restart of console-login (what a console logout does)
#              ttymon read /etc/logindevperm and changed no DRM node; and
#              drmadm status lists each new-stack node at its minor_perm
#              values. On packages without the fix the node checks fail.
#   rewrite    drmadm -R perms on scratch roots: the packaged rule and a
#              mixed rule are restricted (the mixed one split), rules with
#              a driver list and pattern rules are left and reported, the
#              file keeps its owner, group and mode, a second run and 20
#              concurrent runs give the same file and leave no temporary
#              file, and a rule that would exceed libdevinfo's line length
#              is refused with the file unchanged.
#   minorperm  two matching /etc/minor_perm patterns for virtio_gpu's card
#              node (D): drmadm status expects the mode the kernel applied
#              (the later pattern's); the entries are removed again.
#   repair     the packaged /etc/logindevperm back (pkg revert) and a
#              console-login restart reproduce the fault (ttymon sets the
#              nodes to 0600 root root); a restart of drm-perms then
#              restricts the rule and resets the nodes to 0666 root sys.
#   noload     with every DRM module unloaded, drmadm status and drmadm
#              perms load none (looking a /dev/dri node up would).
#   driver-filter
#              a temporary /etc/logindevperm rule restricted to cdrmnull
#              (FILTER) sets cdrmnull's nodes to 0600 root root at a
#              console-login restart and leaves virtio_gpu's (OTHER)
#              alone, as the restricted rule does for the legacy i915; the
#              rule is removed again and drmadm perms resets the nodes.
#   upgrade    on a system whose nodes the old packages left at 0600 root
#              root: publishes driver/graphics/drmadm from this directory
#              (drmadm, drmadm.8, drm-perms.xml, drmadm.p5m, LICENSE) to
#              the repository REPO, updates the package in the running
#              boot environment, and checks that the service imported with
#              it restricted the rule and reset the nodes at once.
