//! Kernel mode setting (milestone R3).
//!
//! A driver with display hardware implements [`KmsDriver`]: it describes
//! its pipeline ([`Layout`]: planes, CRTCs, encoders, connectors), probes
//! connectors ([`Probe`], usually with an EDID that [`edid`] parses), and
//! checks and applies object states in hooks. The core does the rest of
//! what the uAPI promises: object IDs and properties ([`objects`],
//! [`props`]), framebuffers and blobs, atomic updates with Linux's checks
//! and errnos ([`atomic`], [`state`]), the legacy ioctls as atomic updates
//! ([`legacy`]), vblank counters and events ([`events`]), and the ioctl
//! layer with `read(2)` and `poll(2)` (`dev`, kernel only). [`modes`] and
//! [`formats`] hold the mode and pixel-format tables. `soft` (kernel only)
//! is a software vblank source for hardware without a vblank interrupt.
//!
//! The README's "Mode setting (R3)" sections give the decisions and the
//! differences from Linux.
