//! The event queues of a Linux-KMS device's files (facade 2.0,
//! `drm_illumos_event_reserve`, `_unreserve` and `_deliver` of
//! `drm_lkms.h`).
//!
//! The Linux KMS code builds its events (`struct drm_pending_event`) itself
//! and hands the core the encoded `struct drm_event` when it sends one.
//! Each file has Linux's budget of [`EVENT_SPACE`] bytes (`event_space`):
//! reserving charges it, unreserving gives it back, delivering moves the
//! reserved bytes into the file's read queue, and `read(2)` gives them back
//! when it has copied the event out. Delivered plus reserved bytes never
//! exceed the budget, so the read queue is a byte ring of [`EVENT_SPACE`]
//! bytes allocated when the file opens: delivery only copies, in any
//! context, and never allocates. As for R3, the bytes charged by all files
//! of a device that are not the current master are bounded as well
//! ([`MAX_DEVICE_BYTES`]).
//!
//! A file that is closing ([`LkmsEvents::begin_close`]) loses its queued
//! events at once; later reservations fail with `ENOMEM` and later
//! deliveries are dropped, their space given back, until the file is gone
//! ([`LkmsEvents::close`]).
//!
//! Everything here is plain data behind the caller's lock (`lkms::dev`
//! in the kernel); a reader copies an event out without the lock while it
//! holds the file's read turn ([`LkmsEvents::begin_read`]), during which
//! deliveries only write the free part of the ring.
