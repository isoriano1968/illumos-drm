//! A software vblank source for drivers without a vblank interrupt.
//!
//! [`SoftVblank`] runs a `ddi_periodic(9F)` callback every 10 ms (the
//! resolution of that interface) and calls the driver once for each frame
//! boundary of the mode that has passed, with the boundary's exact time.
//! Frame boundaries are computed from `gethrtime(9F)` and the frame length,
//! so the counter advances at the mode's refresh rate on average (60 Hz is
//! 16.67 ms) and timestamps are exact, while each vblank is reported up to
//! 10 ms after its time. If the callback falls behind by more than four
//! frames (a stalled system), the missed boundaries are skipped and the
//! source continues from the latest one.
