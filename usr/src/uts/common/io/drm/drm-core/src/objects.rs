//! GEM handles and FLINK names: the rules of Linux's `drm_gem.c`, as plain
//! data so that they can be tested on the host.
//!
//! A GEM object is reference-counted ([`crate::karc::KArc`]). Three kinds
//! of table hold references to it:
//!
//! * the handle table of each open file ([`IdMap`], numbers from 1), one
//!   reference per handle;
//! * the device's name table for `GEM_FLINK`/`GEM_OPEN` (another
//!   [`IdMap`]), one reference per named object;
//! * user mappings and in-flight work, which the kernel layer manages.
//!
//! Every object counts its handles across all files in
//! [`ObjCommon::handle_count`]. As in Linux, the count and the name are
//! only changed with the device's name table locked
//! (`dev->object_name_lock`), and a name exists only while the object has
//! handles: when the last handle goes, the name goes too, and `GEM_OPEN`
//! can no longer find the object even if mappings keep it alive.
//!
//! # Driver hooks
//!
//! A driver may want to know which files use an object (virtio-gpu
//! attaches a resource to the file's rendering context). Linux calls the
//! object's `open` callback for every new handle and `close` for every
//! removed one; here they run once per file and object ([`Hooks`]):
//! `opened` when a file gains its first handle to the object, `closed`
//! when its last one goes. A file may still hold several handles to one
//! object (`GEM_OPEN` and `MODE_GETFB` make a new one each time, as in
//! Linux), but only the first and the last change what the driver set up,
//! so closing a second handle, or importing an object the file holds
//! already, never takes the object away from the file's other handle.
//! A driver that keeps per-handle state (i915's lookup tables) is told
//! about every other removed handle too ([`Hooks::handle_dropped`]), as
//! Linux's `close` for every handle would.
//! Each file's [`FileTable`] has a hook lock that is held across the
//! decision, the hook and the change of the table, so that the hooks of
//! one file and object strictly alternate even when several threads of a
//! process add and remove handles at once. `PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE` looks for
//! the file's existing handle with the same lock held
//! ([`Locked::find`]), as Linux's per-file PRIME lock does.
//!
//! # Lock order
//!
//! A file's hook lock comes first; the driver's hooks run with it held
//! and no other lock of this module. The name table lock is taken before
//! a file's handle table lock, never after: [`handle_create`] runs with
//! both held (name table first), and closing a handle removes it with only
//! the file's lock held ([`handle_delete`]) and then accounts for it with
//! only the name table lock held ([`handle_released`]). References that
//! come out of the tables are dropped by the caller after the locks are
//! released, because destroying an object takes other locks. The functions
//! here never drop a reference themselves.
//!
//! Adding a handle scans the file's table only for an object that has
//! handles somewhere, and removing one only if the object still has
//! handles, so creating and closing a file's own buffers stays cheap.
//!
//! The tests drive these rules from eight threads with the same locking
//! and check the invariants after every step.
