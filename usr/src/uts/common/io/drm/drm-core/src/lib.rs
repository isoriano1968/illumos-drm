//! The DRM core for illumos.
//!
//! This crate is the part of a DRM driver that every driver shares: it
//! registers the device's card and render nodes, keeps per-file state
//! (authentication, master, client capabilities) through clone opens, and
//! answers the core ioctls that libdrm uses to find and open a device:
//! `VERSION`, `GET_CAP`, `SET_CLIENT_CAP`, `GET_UNIQUE`, `SET_UNIQUE`,
//! `SET_VERSION`, `GET_MAGIC`, `AUTH_MAGIC`, `GET_CLIENT`, `SET_MASTER` and
//! `DROP_MASTER`. A caller's argument structure may be shorter or longer
//! than the kernel's, as with Linux's `drm_ioctl()` ([`ioctl`]). Unknown
//! commands fail with `ENOTTY`, and core commands from a 32-bit process
//! fail with `ENOTSUP`, because only the LP64 ABI is supported.
//!
//! Since milestone R1 it also has GEM buffer objects ([`gem`]): per-file
//! handles, FLINK names, fake mmap offsets and `mmap(2)` through
//! `devmap(9E)`, system-memory objects from `ddi_umem_alloc(9F)` with an
//! optional DMA scatter/gather table, dumb buffers, and the ioctls
//! `GEM_CLOSE`, `GEM_FLINK`, `GEM_OPEN`, `MODE_CREATE_DUMB`,
//! `MODE_MAP_DUMB` and `MODE_DESTROY_DUMB`, plus driver-private ioctls.
//! References to objects can be dropped in interrupt context
//! ([`defer`]).
//!
//! Since milestone R3 it does kernel mode setting ([`kms`]): mode objects
//! and properties, framebuffers and blobs, atomic commits with the legacy
//! ioctls built on them, vblank counters and events read through `read(2)`
//! and `poll(2)`, and EDID parsing, for drivers that implement
//! [`kms::KmsDriver`] and return it from [`Driver::kms`].
//!
//! Since facade 2.0 a C driver may do its mode setting with Linux's KMS
//! code instead ([`lkms`]): the core forwards the mode-setting ioctls to it
//! and keeps the files, their event queues and the client capabilities.
//!
//! The handle and name tables are `alloc::collections::BTreeMap`s, so the
//! driver module must provide a global allocator: enable the
//! `global-alloc-sleep` feature of the `ddi` crate, as `rdrmnull` does. The
//! core only inserts into those maps with the `Sleepable` token; all its
//! other allocations go through [`kvec::KVec`] and [`karc::KArc`], which
//! choose `KM_SLEEP` or `KM_NOSLEEP` per call.
//!
//! The crate is a `no_std` library on top of the `ddi` crate. Since R5a
//! exactly one kernel module compiles it with its `kernel` feature (the
//! stateful layer: devices, GEM, fences, sync objects, PRIME, the table of
//! device numbers in [`minor`] and [`slots`]): `misc/drm_core`
//! (`modules/drm_core`), which instantiates [`Device`] over its facade
//! driver and exports the C facade of `include/drm`. Drivers do not use
//! this crate's kernel layer: Rust drivers go through the `drm-facade`
//! crate, C drivers through the headers, and both are linked with
//! `-N misc/drm_core`. Without the `kernel` feature the crate offers the
//! value helpers drivers may share (display modes, dumb-buffer layouts).
//! The [`Driver`] trait is the interface between the core and
//! `misc/drm_core`'s facade driver.
//!
//! The logic that decides things ([`state`], [`caps`], [`ioctl`],
//! [`minor`], [`objects`], [`idmap`], [`offsets`], [`dumb`], [`dmaerr`], [`karc`],
//! [`defer`]) is plain data and is unit-tested on the host, several parts
//! from many threads; [`Device`] and [`gem`] are the kernel layer that
//! copies arguments, holds the locks and calls the DDI.
