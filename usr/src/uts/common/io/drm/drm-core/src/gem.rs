//! GEM objects in the kernel: the object and its references, the
//! system-memory backend, the per-device tables and the `devmap(9E)`
//! callbacks that map objects into processes.
//!
//! # Objects and references
//!
//! A driver's buffer type implements [`GemObject`]. The core wraps it in a
//! reference-counted [`GemInner`], together with the core's bookkeeping
//! ([`ObjCommon`]: size, handle count, FLINK name, mmap offset) and the list
//! of the object's user mappings. A [`GemRef`] is one counted reference.
//! References are held by handles (one per handle, in the file's table), by
//! the name table (one per named object), by user mappings (one per
//! mapping piece), by `mmap(2)` calls in progress, and by whatever a driver
//! keeps for in-flight work.
//!
//! Dropping a reference follows the rule of [`crate::defer`]:
//! [`GemRef::put`] with the [`Sleepable`] token destroys the object at once
//! if it was the last reference, [`GemRef::put_atomic`] with the [`Atomic`]
//! token parks it for the device's task queue. A `GemRef` that is dropped
//! implicitly is treated as if it were dropped in interrupt context, so an
//! object is never destroyed in a context that may not block. Destroying an
//! object removes its mmap offset, frees its backing (for [`SysMem`]:
//! `ddi_dma_unbind_handle(9F)` and `ddi_umem_free(9F)`) and updates the
//! statistics.
//!
//! # Locks
//!
//! [`GemCore`] holds the device-wide state, each behind its own mutex:
//! the name table (`names`), the offset table (`offsets`), the per-file
//! handle tables (`files`, each file's table behind a mutex of its own,
//! with the file's hook lock before it: see [`crate::objects`]), and the
//! `mmap(2)` calls in progress (`pending`). Each object has a mutex for its
//! list of mappings. The order is: a file's hook lock (held while the
//! driver's [`GemObject::handle_opened`] and [`GemObject::handle_closed`]
//! run), `names`, then a file's handle table, then an object's mappings;
//! `offsets`, `files` and `pending` are leaves that are never held while
//! taking another lock. The core drops no reference with a lock held,
//! because destroying an object takes `offsets`; only a driver's hooks and
//! its `gem_prime_import`, which run with the file's hook lock held, may,
//! because destroying an object never takes a hook lock (an object with a
//! handle is not destroyed).
//! [`crate::objects`] states the rules for handles and names and is tested
//! on the host from several threads with the same order.
//!
//! # Mappings
//!
//! `mmap(2)` on a DRM file runs `devmap_setup(9F)`, which calls the
//! device's `devmap(9E)` entry point (`GemCore::devmap`). It finds the
//! object whose offset range starts exactly at the requested offset, takes
//! a reference, and describes the object's memory with
//! `devmap_umem_setup(9F)`, registering the callbacks below. The reference
//! is parked in `pending`, keyed by the mapping handle, because the
//! framework may free the handle without any further callback if the
//! `mmap(2)` fails later (it does for `MAP_PRIVATE` requests, for one).
//! Both entry points run in the thread that called `mmap(2)`, and the core
//! validates the whole range in one `devmap(9E)` call, so an entry that a
//! thread left behind belongs to a failed call: the next GEM entry point of
//! that thread drops it, and `close(9E)` drops whatever the file's threads
//! left. `devmap_map(9E)` then takes the reference out of `pending`,
//! checks that the mapping is shared and that the file holds a handle to
//! the object (Linux's `drm_vma_node_is_allowed`), and records the mapping.
//! `devmap_dup(9E)` (fork) and `devmap_unmap(9E)` (munmap, exit, and the
//! split of a mapping that is partly unmapped) take and drop references for
//! each piece; a piece that a split leaves always gets private data with its
//! own reference, and stays unsettled until its next fault
//! ([`Mapping::is_settled`]). `devmap_access(9E)` settles such a piece and
//! then asks the object; the default loads the translations with
//! `devmap_default_access(9F)`.
//!
//! A mapping keeps its file open (specfs does not call `close(9E)` while
//! the file is mapped), and the device cannot detach while a file is open,
//! so the device outlives every mapping and every object.
//!
//! The callbacks find the device through a table indexed by device number
//! (`registry`), because `devmap_map(9E)` receives only the device
//! number. Each kernel module links one DRM driver, so each index belongs
//! to one object type; the table also records the type and refuses a
//! mismatch.
