//! Fences with Linux's public layout: Linux's `dma_fence` semantics on the
//! facade's `struct dma_fence` (`include/drm/dma_fence.h`), whether a
//! driver embedded it in its own structure or the core allocated it.
//!
//! # The public fields are the state
//!
//! The structure's fields are what Linux drivers read and write: the lock
//! (`extern_lock`, or `inline_lock` with `DMA_FENCE_FLAG_INLINE_LOCK_BIT`),
//! `cb_list` (a Linux list of `struct dma_fence_cb` under that lock),
//! `flags` (changed atomically), `timestamp` (replacing `cb_list` once
//! signalled), `error`, `refcount` and the driver's `ops`. The functions
//! here implement Linux's rules on them: [`signal_locked`] sets the
//! signalled bit, takes the callback list off the fence and runs every
//! callback with the lock held; [`add_callback`] enables signalling
//! (`ops->enable_signaling`, once) and links the callback; [`is_signaled`]
//! polls `ops->signaled`; [`wait_timeout`] calls `ops->wait` or waits
//! through the core. A driver that signals its fences itself, as i915's
//! breadcrumbs do (set the bit, replace the list, run the callbacks), is
//! seen by the core like any other signaller.
//!
//! # The core's view: one more callback
//!
//! The rest of the core (sync objects, reservations, sync files, arrays,
//! chains and waits) works on [`Fence`], its own fence object. Each
//! structure carries one in its private tail ([`FenceCore`]):
//!
//! * A driver's fence (`dma_fence_init`, a *native* fence) gets a *shadow*
//!   core fence in the module's domain. When the core first takes the
//!   structure ([`core_fence`]), it enables signalling and adds the
//!   *bridge*, a `struct dma_fence_cb` inside the tail state, to the
//!   structure's `cb_list`; the bridge signals the shadow with the
//!   structure's error. The bridge holds a reference to the structure
//!   until it has run, as a Linux sync object holds the fence it waits
//!   for, so a fence the core waits on cannot be released unsignalled.
//! * A fence the core hands out (a sync object's fence, the stub,
//!   `drm_illumos_fence_create`) gets a structure allocated by the core, a
//!   *proxy*, whose ops are the core's own ([`PROXY_OPS`]):
//!   `enable_signaling` adds the *relay*, a core callback on the core
//!   fence that signals the structure, and `signaled` asks the core fence.
//!   The relay holds no reference: it takes one with [`get_unless_zero`]
//!   and does nothing once the structure's count is zero; the structure's
//!   release removes the relay first, waiting for a relay that runs, so
//!   the memory is valid while a relay can touch it. Signalling a proxy
//!   also signals its core fence.
//!
//! Proxies and native fences therefore take the same paths; a core fence
//! may have several proxies, each with its own lock and callbacks.
//!
//! # Release
//!
//! The last [`put`] releases the structure: callbacks still on the list of
//! an unsignalled fence run with `-EDEADLK` (Linux's rule, with a
//! warning), the tail state goes (a relay is removed, which waits for a
//! relay that runs), an inline lock is destroyed, and `ops->release` frees
//! the driver's memory. That needs thread context and must not run under
//! the fence's own lock, nor on a thread whose own signalling still has the
//! relay queued. So the last reference is released at once only in thread
//! context, by a thread that does not hold the lock, and only for a
//! structure without an armed relay; in interrupt context, from a callback
//! of the fence, from the bridge and the relay, and for every proxy whose
//! relay is armed (a callback on another proxy of the same core fence may
//! drop its last reference while this proxy's relay is queued behind it on
//! the same thread) it is parked through the tail's [`RawDefer`] node on
//! the module domain's list and released by its task queue
//! ([`FenceDomain::defer_raw`]). This also removes R5a's last spin: a
//! release never waits for a callback on the processor or thread it
//! interrupted.
//!
//! The logic is tested on the host with mock ops and real threads
//! (`tests` below); the kernel module's `dma_fence_*` functions are thin
//! wrappers.
