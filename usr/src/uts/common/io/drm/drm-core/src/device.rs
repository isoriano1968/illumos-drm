//! A registered DRM device and its character-device entry points.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! All mutable state of a device (open files, masters, magic numbers,
//! client capabilities) is one [`DeviceState`] behind one `ddi::Mutex`.
//! Every entry point takes the mutex for exactly one state transition:
//! `open(9E)` registers the file, `close(9E)` removes it, and each ioctl
//! runs its permission check and its state change inside the same critical
//! section, so no check can be invalidated before its action (a master
//! cannot be dropped between `AUTH_MAGIC`'s permission check and the
//! authentication, for example). Copies from and to user memory happen
//! outside the mutex, before and after the critical section, so a page
//! fault on a user buffer never holds up other files. The only operation
//! that may block with the mutex held is table growth with `KM_SLEEP`,
//! which waits for memory, not for another file.
//!
//! The lifetime rules come from specfs: every open is a clone open, so each
//! file has its own device number and `close(9E)` is called exactly once,
//! after the last reference to the file is gone, and never concurrently
//! with an ioctl on the same file (an ioctl holds a file reference).
//! `detach(9E)` is not called while any file is open; the core refuses it
//! anyway if the state still counts open files.
//!
//! The state machine behind these entry points is unit-tested on the host,
//! including a test that drives it from eight threads through a mutex
//! (`state::tests::concurrent_open_close_auth_master`); the kernel side is
//! exercised with concurrent opens and ioctls by `tools/test/drm_r0_test.c`.
//!
//! GEM state (handles, names, objects, mappings) lives in a separate
//! [`GemCore`] with its own locks (see [`crate::gem`]); the device mutex is
//! never held while one of them is taken. A GEM ioctl checks its permission
//! under the device mutex and acts under the GEM locks afterwards. That gap
//! is harmless because the permissions GEM ioctls depend on cannot be lost:
//! a file's node kind never changes and a file never loses its
//! authentication. `close(9E)` runs only after every ioctl of the file has
//! returned, so no GEM ioctl can see a file whose GEM state is gone.
//!
//! A Linux-KMS device (facade 2.0, [`crate::lkms`]) adds the event queues
//! of its files behind their own lock, which the driver's KMS code takes
//! from its event functions, also in interrupt context; the device mutex
//! may be held while taking it (a file's master status is mirrored into
//! its queue), never the other way round, and neither is held while the
//! KMS code's hooks run.
