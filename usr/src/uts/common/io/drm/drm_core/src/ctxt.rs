//! The driver ioctls in progress, by thread.
//!
//! A facade ioctl handler (`drm_ioctl_t`) receives a kernel copy of its
//! argument, as on Linux. The facade functions that need the ioctl itself
//! (`drm_copy_from_user` and `drm_copy_to_user` need its data model and
//! `FKIOCTL` flag; `dma_buf_fd`, `dma_buf_get`, `drm_sync_file_install` and
//! `sync_file_get_fence` need the `IoctlArg` that carries its device number,
//! illumos-ddi's rule for making file descriptors) find it here: the facade
//! driver records a frame for the calling thread around the handler.
//! Ioctls of one file may run on several threads at once, so the table is
//! keyed by the thread (`ddi_get_kt_did(9F)`).
