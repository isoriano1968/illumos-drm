//! The facade's C functions, one module per header of `include/drm`. The
//! headers document every function; the comments here only say how each
//! maps onto the core. Every pointer a caller passes is checked against
//! the marks the facade put into the structures it set up (`__core`), so a
//! wrong or stale pointer is refused (`-EINVAL`, `NULL`) instead of being
//! followed, as far as such a check can tell.
//!
//! The context of a call: functions documented for thread context assume
//! it (their callers are ioctl handlers, attach and detach); the few that
//! a driver may call from an interrupt handler (`dma_fence_signal`,
//! `dma_fence_put`, `drm_gem_object_put`, ...) ask illumos-ddi which
//! context they run in; the event functions of `drm_lkms.h` never block
//! in either.
