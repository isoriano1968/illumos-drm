 * Linux's struct timer_list, with the layer's state (src/lkpi_timer.c)
 * embedded so that arming a timer never allocates: lkpi_node links a
 * pending timer into the layer's tree of pending timers, ordered by
 * lkpi_expires (the expiry copied when the timer is armed) and then by
 * lkpi_seq. Drivers write `expires` (i915 zeroes it after
 * timer_delete()), so the tree never uses it as its key. lkpi_seq is
 * non-zero exactly while the timer is pending; lkpi_state holds the
 * shut-down flag. `entry` is unused (kept for Linux's layout); expiries
 * are in jiffies. A zero-filled timer_list (DEFINE_TIMER()) is a valid
 * idle timer.
