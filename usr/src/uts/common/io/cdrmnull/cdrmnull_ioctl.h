 *		bit stays clear until dma_fence_is_signaled() polls.
 * DEFERRED	a timeline fence whose last reference the soft interrupt
 *		drops is released later in thread context (ops->release
 *		sees no interrupt context).
 * QUEUED	a callback that drops a native fence's last reference: the

 *		while this thread adds and removes callbacks: each runs at
 *		most once, a removed one never, a kept one exactly once.
