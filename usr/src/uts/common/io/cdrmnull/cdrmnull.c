/*
 * cdrmnull: a DRM driver without hardware, in C, on the illumos-drm facade.
 *
 * cdrmnull is the C port of the Rust test driver rdrmnull and the first C
 * driver of misc/drm_core (work item R5a): it uses nothing of the DRM core
 * but the facade's C functions (include/drm), and it is linked against
 * misc/drm_core (ld -N misc/drm_core) instead of carrying a copy of the
 * core. It registers one DRM device per instance of its pseudo node
 * (cdrmnull.conf asks for instance 0), with the primary node card<N> and
 * the render node renderD<128+N>, and declares mode setting and atomic
 * support, as rdrmnull does, so that every capability path of the core
 * answers. It has no display: rdrmnull's virtual display (milestone R3)
 * waits for the C mode-setting core (R5i). Nor does it port rdrmnull's
 * DMA test properties (dma-mode, dma-max-transfer), which exercise the
 * core's DMA binding on the device's own node; the Rust driver keeps
 * them.
 *
 * GEM objects and dumb buffers live in system memory. As a pseudo device
 * it does no DMA, so its objects have no scatter/gather table.
 *
 * It has driver-private ioctls that exist only for the kernel tests
 * (tools/test/drm_r1_test.c, drm_r2_test.c), with rdrmnull's numbers,
 * structures and errors (cdrmnull_ioctl.h):
 *
 * - CREATE_MOVABLE makes an object with two backings, the stand-in for an
 *   object a GPU's memory manager moves between system memory and VRAM.
 * - MOVE invalidates every user mapping of such an object with
 *   devmap_unload(9F) and, unless asked not to, switches the object to its
 *   other backing with devmap_umem_remap first. The next access through
 *   an existing mapping faults into devmap_access(9E), which loads the
 *   translation with devmap_load(9F).
 * - PUT_LATER takes a reference to an object and drops it from a
 *   timeout(9F) callback with drm_illumos_gem_object_put_deferred(), which
 *   exercises the deferred release of the core (timeout(9F) callbacks run
 *   on callout threads, which drm_gem_object_put() cannot tell from thread
 *   context).
 * - HOLD keeps a reference to an object until it is asked to drop it, also
 *   across the close of every file. detach(9E) is then refused, and the
 *   test checks that the device still works.
 * - FENCE creates a fence on the device's test timeline that signals after
 *   delay_ms milliseconds (optionally with an error), and puts it into a
 *   sync object at a point, into a buffer's reservation (as a writer or a
 *   reader), and/or into a new sync file. A timeout(9F) callback triggers
 *   a soft interrupt, whose handler signals every fence that is due, as a
 *   GPU driver signals fences from its completion interrupt; the fences'
 *   callbacks run there, in interrupt context.
 * - BO_WAIT waits for a buffer's reservation, as a driver's wait ioctl
 *   does.
 * - PRIME_SELFTEST (new in cdrmnull) imports a dma-buf or exports a
 *   buffer through the facade's dma-buf functions.
 * - FENCE_OPS_SELFTEST (R5b) drives fences with driver ops: a mock fence
 *   type with counting ops, and the test timeline, whose fences have
 *   enable_signaling and signaled as a GPU's do (the soft interrupt
 *   signals only fences somebody asked for; the others are found complete
 *   by polling).
 * - HANDLES (R5b) walks the caller's handles with
 *   drm_illumos_gem_for_each_handle() and reads an object's live
 *   reference count.
 * - PRINT_SELFTEST (R5b) prints through drm_printer and the drm_* and
 *   DRM_* logging macros.
 *
 * Each device registers managed resources at attach (drmm_*), whose
 * release order it checks when the device goes.
 *
 * A detach attempt cancels the timers and signals the fences that are left
 * with ECANCELED (illumos_before_detach), because every fence must signal.
 * The soft interrupt stays until the detach is sure to complete
 * (illumos_before_teardown), so a refused detach leaves the timeline
 * working.
 *
 * The test fences are the driver's own structures (struct cdrmnull_tlf,
 * dma_fence_init()), so they belong to the fence domain of misc/drm_core
 * (kstat drm:0:sync), not to the device's (kstat cdrmnull:<N>:sync).
 *
 * Two symbols outside the DDI are used: devmap_umem_remap and, by the
 * fence tests, servicing_interrupt (see below and private.mapfile).
