 * and out only in the directions both the caller's command and the
 * entry's `cmd` have, as Linux does: an _IOW call of an _IOWR entry is
 * copied in and not back out, and an _IOR call of an _IOWR entry is not

 * DRM_COMMAND_BASE (0x40) to below 0xa0.
 *
 * Matching, in three stages:
 *  1. the entry whose `cmd` equals the caller's complete command value,
 *     so a table may list one number several times with different
 *     structure sizes (older layouts of one ioctl) or directions;
 *  2. otherwise the first entry with the same number and direction, of
 *     any size;
 *  3. otherwise, as Linux's drm_ioctl() (which indexes the table by
 *     number), the first entry with the same number in any direction:
 *     i915 lists DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2_WR (_IOWR) only, and Mesa
 *     calls DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2 (_IOW, the same number).
 * After stages 2 and 3 the argument follows Linux's size rule: a shorter
 * caller structure is zero-extended, a longer one keeps its extra bytes,
 * and the handler always sees at least the table's size; it is copied in
 * the directions both commands have (drm_ioctl_t). A number with no entry
 * fails with ENOTTY, and any driver command from a 32-bit process with
 * ENOTSUP.
