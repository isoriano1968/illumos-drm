/*
 * A driver. One static table per driver module, passed to
 * drm_dev_alloc(); the core reads it, never writes it.
 *
 * open		called for each open(2) of a card or render node, after
 *		the core has set the file up; a negative errno fails the
 *		open. Optional.
 * postclose	called at the file's close(9E), after the core has released
 *		its handles; frees driver_priv. Optional.
 * release	called when the last reference to the device is dropped,
 *		before the core frees the structure. Optional.
 * gem_prime_import
 *		imports a dma-buf of another device. NULL means
 *		drm_gem_prime_import(), which makes a core object that shares
 *		the exporter's memory. Optional.
 * dumb_create	MODE_CREATE_DUMB. Required for dumb buffers: allocate an
 *		object (drm_gem_object_init()), create a handle
 *		(drm_gem_handle_create()), fill in handle, pitch and size.
 *		The core has checked the caller's permission.
 * dumb_map_offset
 *		MODE_MAP_DUMB. NULL means drm_gem_dumb_map_offset().
 * major, minor, patchlevel, name, desc
 *		what the VERSION ioctl reports.
 * driver_features
 *		DRIVER_* flags; DRIVER_SYNCOBJ_TIMELINE needs DRIVER_SYNCOBJ.
 *		DRIVER_MODESET with illumos_rkms (and DRIVER_GEM) has a
 *		display; with illumos_lkms it has one once
 *		drm_dev_illumos_lkms_register() succeeded (drm_lkms.h); with
 *		neither the device reports the mode-setting capabilities but
 *		has no display objects, and the mode-setting ioctls fail with
 *		EOPNOTSUPP. drm_dev_register() takes the device's
 *		driver_features (drm_device), not the table's.
 * ioctls, num_ioctls
 *		the driver's private ioctls (drm_ioctl.h).
 *
 * illumos_facade_major, illumos_facade_minor
 *		the facade version the driver was compiled against; set them
 *		with DRM_FACADE_DRIVER_VERSION. drm_dev_alloc() refuses a
 *		table of another major version or a newer minor version.
 * illumos_date	the date VERSION reports (Linux dropped it); NULL is "0".
 * illumos_max_object_size, illumos_max_memory
 *		the largest GEM object and the most object memory of one
 *		device, in bytes; 0 means 256 MiB and 1 GiB.
 * illumos_before_detach
 *		called first by a drm_dev_unregister() that may still be
 *		refused: stop starting new work and signal the fences the
 *		driver owns (with an error), because every fence must
 *		signal. Optional.
 * illumos_before_teardown
 *		called once drm_dev_unregister() is sure to succeed, before
 *		the mode-setting and GEM state go: stop vblank and fence
 *		sources. Optional.
 * illumos_rkms	mode setting with the core's R3 implementation (drm_rkms.h).
 * illumos_lkms	facade 2.0: mode setting with Linux's KMS code carried in C
 *		(drm_lkms.h, misc/drm_kms), started by the driver with
 *		drm_dev_illumos_lkms_register() after drm_dev_register(). At
 *		most one of illumos_rkms and illumos_lkms; drm_dev_alloc()
 *		refuses a table with both, or an illumos_lkms without one of
 *		its required hooks.
