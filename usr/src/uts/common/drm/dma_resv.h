 * drm_illumos_resv_unlock_ctx()
 *	transactions that a compatibility layer keeps (Linux's
 *	ww_acquire_ctx): a stamp from the core's reservation class, then
 *	lock with the stamp and the number of reservations the transaction
 *	holds; the core applies its wait-die rule against every holder.
 *	0, -EDEADLK (release everything, then lock the contended one with
 *	slow), -EALREADY (held by the transaction), -EINTR (intr), -EINVAL.
 *	The lock belongs to the calling thread; release it with
 *	drm_illumos_resv_unlock_ctx() and the same stamp (0, or -EPERM and
 *	the lock unchanged if the thread does not hold it for that stamp).
 *	drm_illumos_resv_trylock_ctx() takes it for the stamp without
 *	waiting (false if held); drm_illumos_resv_is_locked() reports
 *	whether anyone holds it (assertions).
 * drm_illumos_resv_fences()
 *	a snapshot of the fences with a usage at least as important as
 *	`usage` (unsignalled ones only, unless `flags` has
 *	DRM_ILLUMOS_RESV_SIGNALED): up to `max` of them, each with a new
 *	reference, into `fences`, the usage of each into `usages` (if not
 *	NULL; an enum dma_resv_usage value), and the number the reservation
 *	had into `*count` (retry with a larger array when it exceeds max;
 *	the stored fences are the caller's to put either way). Every fence
 *	appears once. A fence a driver made with dma_fence_init() comes back
 *	as that driver's own structure while it lives (so i915 recognises its
 *	requests); other fences as structures the core made. Thread context.
