 * The core keeps the ioctl entry point, the argument copies (Linux's size

 * capabilities (mirrored into struct drm_file), GET_CAP, the files and
 * their event queues (read(2), chpoll(9E), the 4096-byte budget), GEM,
 * PRIME and sync objects. The Linux KMS code keeps the mode objects and
 * their IDs, properties, blobs, framebuffers, atomic state, vblank

 * The hooks of a Linux KMS implementation (drm_driver.illumos_lkms). The
 * core uses them once drm_dev_illumos_lkms_register() (below) has started
 * mode setting on the device; before that, and for a device it does not
 * start, the mode-setting ioctls fail with EOPNOTSUPP and GET_CAP and
 * SET_CLIENT_CAP answer as for a device without DRIVER_MODESET. Every
 * hook runs in thread context without core locks held. Required: ioctl,
 * file_open, file_close, register_dev, unregister_dev, mode_config.
 *
 * ioctl	a mode-setting ioctl of the core's mode-setting table
 *		(DRM_IOCTL_MODE_*, WAIT_VBLANK, MODESET_CTL,
 *		CRTC_GET/QUEUE_SEQUENCE), after the core's permission check.
 *		nr is the command's number (the low byte, as Linux's
 *		DRM_IOCTL_NR()); data is the kernel copy of the argument, of
 *		the size Linux's handler expects (shorter user structures are
 *		zero-extended); the core copies it back for commands that
 *		write. Returns 0 or a negative errno (-ENOTTY for a number the
 *		implementation does not know).
 * file_open	after the core set the file up, before the driver's open:
 *		initialise the file's KMS area (framebuffer and blob lists,
 *		pending events). A negative errno fails the open. Only for
 *		files opened after mode setting started; a file opened before
 *		gets none of the hooks and EOPNOTSUPP for the mode-setting
 *		ioctls.
 * file_close	at close(9E) of a file file_open accepted, before the core
 *		releases the file's GEM
 *		handles and calls the driver's postclose: unlink the file's
 *		pending events, remove its framebuffers and user blobs
 *		(Linux's drm_file_free() order).
 * lastclose	after the last open file of the device closed (Linux's
 *		drm_lastclose()). Optional.
 * register_dev	in drm_dev_illumos_lkms_register(), after mode_config; the
 *		device is registered and its minor nodes exist (Linux's
 *		drm_modeset_register_all()). A negative errno fails
 *		drm_dev_illumos_lkms_register(): mode setting stays off, the
 *		device stays registered.
 * unregister_dev
 *		once, if register_dev succeeded: in a drm_dev_unregister()
 *		that is going to succeed, before the minor nodes go, or in a
 *		successful drm_dev_illumos_unplug() (Linux's
 *		drm_modeset_unregister_all() in drm_dev_unregister() and
 *		drm_dev_unplug()).
 * mode_config	fills in the mode-setting limits GET_CAP reports (cursor
 *		size, preferred depth, shadow preference, modifiers,
 *		asynchronous flips) from the KMS code's configuration
 *		(Linux's drm_mode_config); called once by
 *		drm_dev_illumos_lkms_register() before register_dev, instead
 *		of the driver calling drm_dev_illumos_set_mode_config().
 *		Required.
